## Introduction

A hotel reservation system simplifies the process of booking accommodations for travelers by providing a centralized platform to search for available hotels, compare prices and amenities, and make reservations. This repository offers a Java implementation of such a system, enabling users to find and book hotels conveniently.

## Features

### 1. Hotel Search

Users can search for hotels based on criteria such as location, dates, number of guests, and desired amenities. The system provides a list of available hotels matching the search criteria, allowing users to compare options before making a reservation.

### 2. Hotel Details

Users can view detailed information about each hotel, including room types, prices, available amenities, and guest reviews. This helps users make informed decisions when selecting a hotel for their stay.

### 3. Reservation Management

Users can make reservations for selected hotels by providing their personal information and payment details. The system confirms the reservation and generates a booking confirmation for the user's reference. Users can also manage their existing bookings, including modifying or canceling reservations as needed.
